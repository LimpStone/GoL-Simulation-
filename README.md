# GoL-Simulation-
Conway's Game of Life simulation with text input and output

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game made with collab py 
Input works:
  First line "X" "space" "Y" to define universe size
  Second line "Frames" to define the number of iterations
  Third lane or superior are used to create points in space, "X" "space" "Y" "space" "Type" XY are the coordinates, Type works with 1 and 2 where 1=point 2=glider
 
 IMPORTANT: The simulation starts as Iteration 0 literally 2 Iterations after the initial Input
